## Project Initiation and Selection

### Identifying Potential Projects
[cite_start]• The first step in project management is deciding what projects to do in the first place [cite: 3].
[cite_start]• Project initiation starts with identifying potential projects, using realistic methods to select which projects to work on, and then formalizing their initiation by issuing some sort of project charter [cite: 3].
[cite_start]• A project charter is a document that defines the objectives, scope, and stakeholders of a project, providing a roadmap for the team to follow [cite: 3].

### Methods For Selecting Projects
[cite_start]Methods for selecting IT projects include [cite: 4]:

| Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focusing on broad organizational needs** | [cite_start]Aligning projects with overall organizational objectives [cite: 4]. |
| **Categorizing IT projects** | [cite_start]Determining whether the project addresses a problem, an opportunity, or a directive [cite: 4]. |
| **Financial analyses** | [cite_start]Performing net present value (NPV), return on investment (ROI), or payback analysis [cite: 4]. |
| **Weighted scoring model** | [cite_start]A project management technique used for weighing certain decisions, such as prioritizing project actions and development of product features [cite: 4]. |
| **Balanced scorecard** | [cite_start]A performance metric companies use to identify and improve internal functions and their resulting external outcomes [cite: 4]. |

## Strategic Planning

### What is Strategic Planning?
[cite_start]• Strategic planning involves determining long-term objectives by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of an organization, studying opportunities and threats in the business environment, predicting future trends, and projecting the need for new products and services [cite: 5].
[cite_start]• Strategic planning provides important information to help organizations identify and then select potential projects [cite: 5].
[cite_start]• SWOT analysis is a key tool used in strategic planning [cite: 5].

### IT Strategic Planning
[cite_start]• IT Strategic planning assesses what investments and technologies will achieve business goals while also considering the impact of funding them [cite: 6].

[cite_start]• Information systems planning transforms organizational goals outlined in the strategic plan into specific systems development activities [cite: 9].

### The Steps of IS Planning
[cite_start]The steps of IS planning are outlined in a systematic process [cite: 10].

### Establishing Objectives for Systems Development
[cite_start]• The overall objective of systems development is to achieve business goals, not technical goals, by delivering the right information to the right person at the right time [cite: 11].
[cite_start]• Mission-critical Systems are systems that play a critical role in an organization's continued operations and goal attainment [cite: 11].

## Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### What is SDLC?
[cite_start]• The systems development life cycle (SDLC) is the systems development process [cite: 14].
[cite_start]• Sometimes, information learned in a particular phase requires cycling back to a previous phase [cite: 15].

### The Five Phases of Traditional SDLC

#### 1. Systems Investigation
[cite_start]• The systems development phase during which problems and opportunities are identified and considered in light of the goals of the business [cite: 16].

#### 2. Systems Analysis
[cite_start]• The systems development phase that determines what the Information System must do to solve the problem by studying existing systems and work processes to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement [cite: 17].

#### 3. Systems Design
[cite_start]• The systems development phase that defines how the information system will do what it must do to obtain the problem solution [cite: 18].

#### 4. Systems Implementation
[cite_start]• The systems development phase involving the creation or acquisition of various system components detailed in the systems design, assembling them, and placing the new or modified system into operation [cite: 19].

#### 5. Systems Maintenance And Review
[cite_start]• The systems development phase that ensures the system operates and modifies the system so that it continues to meet changing business needs [cite: 19].

## Alternative Development Approaches

### Prototyping
[cite_start]• An iterative approach to the systems development process [cite: 20].
[cite_start]• During each iteration, requirements and alternative solutions to the problem are identified and analyzed, new solutions are designed, and a portion of the system is implemented [cite: 20].
[cite_start]• Users are then encouraged to try the prototype and provide feedback [cite: 20].
[cite_start]• Each generation of prototype is a refinement of the previous generation based on user feedback [cite: 21].

#### Types of Prototypes
* [cite_start]**Operational prototype**: A prototype that works—accesses real data files, edits input data, makes necessary computations and comparisons, and produces real output [cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Nonoperational prototype**: A mock-up, or model, that includes output and input specifications and formats [cite: 20].

### Rapid Application Development (RAD)
[cite_start]• A systems development approach that employs tools, techniques, and methodologies designed to speed application development [cite: 22].

### Joint Application Development (JAD)
[cite_start]• A process for data collection and requirements analysis in which users, stakeholders, and IS professionals work together to analyze existing systems, propose possible solutions, and define the requirements of a new or modified system [cite: 23].

## Factors Affecting Systems Development Success

[cite_start]Three major factors affect systems development success [cite: 24]:

### 1. Degree of Change
[cite_start]• A major factor that affects the quality of systems development is the degree of change associated with the project [cite: 24].
[cite_start]• The scope can vary from enhancing an existing system to major reengineering [cite: 24].
[cite_start]• The project team needs to recognize where they are on this spectrum of change [cite: 24].

### 2. Managing Change
[cite_start]• The ability to manage change is critical to the success of systems development [cite: 25].
[cite_start]• The work environment and habits of users are invariably affected by the development of a new information system [cite: 25].
[cite_start]• Managing change requires the ability to recognize existing or potential problems (particularly the concerns of users) and deal with them before they become a serious threat to the success of the new or modified system [cite: 25].

#### Common Problems from New or Modified Systems
[cite_start]The most common problems that often need to be addressed include [cite: 25]:
* Fear that the employee will lose his job, power, or influence within the organization
* Belief that the proposed system will create more work than it eliminates
* Reluctance to work with "computer people"
* Anxiety that the proposed system will negatively alter the structure of the organization
* Unwillingness to learn new procedures or approaches

### 3. Quality and Standards
[cite_start]• Quality and standards are key success factors for systems development [cite: 26].
[cite_start]• Corporations are expanding their standards to include many different computer platforms [cite: 26].
[cite_start]• Many companies try to standardize their operations on one operating system, while others have multiple systems and platforms to take advantage of the strengths of each [cite: 26].
[cite_start]• Organizations that do business around the globe may be required to meet certain international standards, such as ISO 9000, a set of international quality standards originally developed in Europe in 1987 [cite: 26].
