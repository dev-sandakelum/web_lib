## Management Information Systems (MIS)

### What is a Management Information System?
[cite_start]• A Management Information System (MIS) is an integrated collection of people, procedures, databases, and devices that provides managers and decision makers with information to help achieve organizational goals [cite: 2].
[cite_start]• MISs can give competitive advantage by providing the right information to the right people in the right format and at the right time [cite: 2].

### MIS Inputs & Outputs

#### Inputs
[cite_start]MIS receives inputs from two main sources [cite: 3]:

| Input Source | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Internal** | [cite_start]Supply chain information, TPS and ERP systems and related databases [cite: 3]. |
| **External** | [cite_start]Customers, suppliers, competitors, and stakeholders, whose data is not already captured by the TPS, as well as other sources, such as the Internet [cite: 3]. |

#### Outputs
[cite_start]• MIS produces a collection of reports as outputs [cite: 3].

### MIS Functions
[cite_start]Key functions of MIS include [cite: 4]:

| Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Improve Decision making** | [cite_start]Provide reports with fixed and standard formats. Produce hard-copy and soft-copy reports. Allow users to develop their own custom reports [cite: 4]. |
| **Use internal data** | [cite_start]Use internal data stored in the computer system [cite: 4]. |
| **Provide connectivity** | [cite_start]MIS provides managers with better connectivity with the rest of the organization [cite: 4]. |
| **Improve efficiency** | [cite_start]MIS helps managers to conduct their tasks with greater ease and with better efficiency. This reflects in better productivity for the company [cite: 4]. |

## Decision Making And Problem Solving

### Decision Making as a Component of Problem Solving
[cite_start]Decision making is a key component of problem solving [cite: 6].

### The Stages of Decision Making and Problem Solving

[cite_start]The decision making and problem-solving process consists of five stages [cite: 7, 8]:

| Stage | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Intelligence Stage** | [cite_start]The first stage of decision making, in which potential problems or opportunities are identified and defined [cite: 7]. |
| **Design Stage** | [cite_start]The second stage of decision making, in which alternative solutions to the problem are developed [cite: 7]. |
| **Choice Stage** | [cite_start]The third stage of decision making, which requires selecting a course of action [cite: 7]. |
| **Implementation Stage** | [cite_start]A stage of problem solving in which a solution is put into effect [cite: 8]. |
| **Monitoring Stage** | [cite_start]The final stage of the problem solving process, in which decision makers evaluate the implementation [cite: 8]. |

[cite_start]• Problem Solving is a process that goes beyond decision making to include the implementation stage [cite: 8].

### Types of Decisions

#### Programmed Decisions
[cite_start]• A programmed decision is a decision made using a rule, procedure, or quantitative method [cite: 9].
[cite_start]• Example: Ordering more products when inventory levels drop to specified levels [cite: 9].

#### Non-programmed Decisions
[cite_start]• A non-programmed decision is a decision that deals with unusual or exceptional situations [cite: 9].
[cite_start]• Example: When there is an economic crisis [cite: 9].

## Decision Support Systems (DSS)

### What is a Decision Support System?
[cite_start]• A decision support system (DSS) is a computerized program used to support determinations, judgments, and courses of action in an organization or a business [cite: 10].

### Characteristics of a Decision Support System
[cite_start]Key characteristics of DSS include [cite: 11]:
* Provide rapid access to information
* Handle large amounts of data from different sources
* Provide report and presentation flexibility
* Offer both textual and graphical orientation
* Perform complex, sophisticated analysis and comparisons using advanced software packages

### Components of a Decision Support System

[cite_start]A DSS consists of three main components [cite: 13]:

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The Database** | [cite_start]Stores the data used by the DSS [cite: 13]. |
| **Dialogue Manager** | [cite_start]A user interface (UI) that allows decision makers to easily access and manipulate the DSS and to use common business terms and phrases [cite: 13]. |
| **Model Base** | [cite_start]Part of a DSS that provides decision makers access to a variety of models and assists them in decision making [cite: 13]. |

[cite_start]Examples of models include Financial (Spreadsheet), Statistical (SPSS), Graphical (PowerPoint), and Project Management (MS Project) [cite: 13].

### A Comparison of DSS and MIS
[cite_start]DSS and MIS differ in their focus and capabilities [cite: 13].

## Executive Support Systems (ESS)

### What is an Executive Support System?
[cite_start]• An Executive Support System (ESS) is a specialized DSS that includes all hardware, software, data, procedures, and people used to assist senior-level executives within the organization [cite: 14].

### The Characteristics of an ESS
[cite_start]Executive Support Systems have the following characteristics [cite: 15]:
* Are tailored to individual executives
* Are easy to use
* Support the need for external data
* Can help with situations that have a high degree of uncertainty
* Have a future orientation
