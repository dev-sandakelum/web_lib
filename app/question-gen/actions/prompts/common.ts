FORMATTING RULES:
- Use semantic HTML tags for content formatting: <b> or <strong> for emphasis, <i> or <em> for italics, <u> for underlines
- Use <ul> and <li> for lists, <ol> for numbered lists
- Use <br> for line breaks when needed (specifically for multiline questions or answers)
-if it has separate questions or sub-questions, must use line breaks to separate them
- Use <code> for inline code or technical terms
- Use <pre> for code blocks if needed
- Do NOT include structural tags like <html>, <body>, <head>, <div>, or <span>
- Ensure all tags are properly closed
- Keep formatting minimal and purposeful - only use when it enhances readability
